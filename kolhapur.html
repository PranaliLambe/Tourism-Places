     <h2>Vishalgad,Kolhapur</h2> 
     <br> 
     <p>Vishalgad, also known as Khelna or Khilna, is a heritage site located at a height of over 3500 feet above sea level. This fort was initially built by Shilahara King Marsinh in 1058 and was called Khilgil. Over the years, it came under the rule of various kings, before being annexed from Adil Shah of Bijapur by Shivaji in 1659, and was thereafter renamed Vishalgad, which means grand fort in Marathi.
        Apart from its main entrance, it is almost impossible to reach the fort as it surrounded by steep cliffs and mountainous terrain of the Sahyadri Range, and thus, conquering it was a great thing achieved by Shivaji. Although in ruins, this site of historical significance is worth a visit.

     <h2>Rankala Lake,Kolhapur</h2> 
     <br> 
     <p>One of the best places to relax with friends and family is the beautiful Rankala Lake that is often referred to as Rankala Chowpatty and Marine Drive of Kolhapur because of the resemblance; food vendors selling tasty snacks, a pathway for a stroll, gardens, horse riding and boating facilities, etc. Many believe that this lake near the statue of Nandi was constructed by Maharaja Shri Shahu Chhatrapati of Kolhapur, while others believe that the lake was formed naturally when the stone quarry got submerged by underground water after an earthquake. The Rankabhairav Temple also got submerged at the centre of the lake, and probably this is why the lake was named Rankala.
