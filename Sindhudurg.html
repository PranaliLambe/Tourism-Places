                <br>
                <p>It's a typical south Goan beach in terms of vibe, but a completely different and unique beach when it comes to serenity, cleanliness, and crystal-clear water. The golden sand stretching for over 2km, rocky cliffs, beachside cafes & restaurants, stalls selling Goan handicrafts combine to accentuate the desirability of this lesser-known beach in Goa. It is great place to avoid crowds and enjoy peaceful walk on sandy beach while enjoying the sunset views.</p>

                <p>A garden just beside a beach might just be something you would want when you feel like getting away from the bustling city life. And that's what Rock Garden in Malvan brings to you. Located right behind the market in Malvan, the well-maintained Rock Garden is the place where the leisure of strolling through the garden meets the sounds and views of sea waves splashing the rocks. Peace right in the heart of chaos is what describes this place aptly. There is also a small toy train which can add to the funtime for the kids visiting the garden.</p>
